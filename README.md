This was the project done for my BMEG 310 class, a basic introduction into bioinformatics.

Unfortunately, the data sets used in this code were too big to upload to github.

The knitted html file can be viewed here: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/moolochi27/Hepatocellular-Carcinoma/blob/main/BMEG310_Final_Project.html

The full analysis was done in Google docs, and the pdf report can be viewed in this repository.

Overall, this was a good introduction to the tools used in bioinformatics, even if the results of the project were a bit disappointing.
